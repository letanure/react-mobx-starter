            This PR updates the CI snapshots for E2E tests. The snapshots were automatically generated in the same environment used by CI to ensure consistency.
            
            ### Changes
            - Updated visual regression test snapshots in `tests/e2e/.snapshots-ci/`
            
            ### How to review
            1. Check that the snapshot changes look reasonable
            2. Run `pnpm test:e2e` locally to verify tests pass
            3. Merge if everything looks good
