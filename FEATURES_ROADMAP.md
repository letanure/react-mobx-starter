# Features Roadmap

This file tracks potential features to add to the React MobX Starter kit to make it more comprehensive for coding challenges.

## Current Features âœ…
- [x] MobX state management with TodoStore
- [x] TypeScript with proper type organization
- [x] Feature-based architecture
- [x] Simple UI components (Button)
- [x] Utility functions (cn, formatDate, getRelativeTime)
- [x] Feature flags configuration
- [x] Basic styling with CSS modules approach

## Planned Features ðŸ“‹

### Core Navigation & Testing
- [x] **React Router** - Navigation/routing patterns
- [x] **i18n** - Internationalization with react-i18next
- [ ] **E2E tests** - Playwright or Cypress setup

### Essential Patterns
- [ ] **Error boundaries** - React error handling
- [ ] **Loading states** - Skeleton screens, spinners
- [ ] **Form validation** - React Hook Form + Zod validation
- [ ] **API integration** - Fetch wrapper with error handling
- [ ] **Environment variables** - Proper .env setup and usage

### UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] **Dark/Light theme** - CSS variables + context pattern
- [ ] **Local storage persistence** - Store data locally
- [ ] **Debounced search** - Performance optimization example
- [ ] **Infinite scroll/Pagination** - List handling patterns
- [ ] **Modal/Dialog system** - Common UI patterns

### Developer Experience
- [ ] **Storybook** - Component documentation
- [ ] **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** - API mocking
- [ ] **Accessibility (a11y)** - Screen reader support patterns

## Priority Order ðŸ”¥

### High Priority
1. **React Router** - Navigation is very common in challenges
2. **Form validation** - Almost every app has forms
3. **API integration** - Real-world necessity
4. **Dark/Light theme** - Shows CSS skills + context patterns

### Medium Priority
5. **Error boundaries** - Professional error handling
6. **Loading states** - Better UX patterns
7. **E2E tests** - Shows testing maturity
8. **Local storage persistence** - Data persistence patterns

### Nice to Have
9. **i18n** - Shows internationalization awareness
10. **Debounced search** - Performance optimization
11. **Modal system** - Advanced UI patterns
12. **Storybook** - Component documentation

## Notes
- Keep each feature minimal but complete
- Focus on patterns that demonstrate skill
- Ensure features work well together
- Maintain simplicity for coding challenges
