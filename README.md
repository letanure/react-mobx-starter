## Key Features

### Feature-Based Architecture
Each feature is self-contained with its own components, state, and routes:

```typescript
features/my-feature/
├── Component.tsx     # UI components
├── store.ts         # MobX store
├── routes.ts        # Route configuration
├── schemas.ts       # Zod validation
└── index.ts         # Feature registry
```

### Schema-First Development
Types derived from Zod validation schemas:

```typescript
// schemas.ts
export const TodoSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().min(1),
  text: z.string().min(1).trim(),
  completed: z.boolean()
})

// types.ts
export type Todo = z.infer<typeof TodoSchema>
```

### Dynamic Form Builder
Powerful form generation with validation:
- All field types included
- Zod schema integration
- Field arrays and nested forms
- See examples in Storybook

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Feature
```bash
# Create feature folder
mkdir src/features/my-feature
cd src/features/my-feature

# Required files
touch index.ts Component.tsx routes.ts schemas.ts
```

### 2. Add UI Components
```bash
# Add shadcn components
npx shadcn@latest add button card

# Check existing components
ls src/components/ui/
```

### 3. Explore Examples
- **Todo App** - Complete CRUD with MobX state
- **API Demo** - External API integration
- **Form Builder** - Dynamic form generation

## What Makes This Different
