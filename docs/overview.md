# Project Overview

A modern React + TypeScript starter kit with batteries included. This project serves as a demo showcase of modern React development practices and provides a solid foundation for building scalable applications.

## What's Included

### Core Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for component development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **MobX** for predictable state management

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent design
- **Custom UI components** with Storybook integration
- **FormBuilder** for dynamic form generation with Zod validation
- **Responsive layout system** with sidebar and fullscreen modes

### Development Experience
- **Hot module replacement** for instant feedback
- **TypeScript strict mode** for type safety
- **Storybook** for component development and documentation
- **Comprehensive testing** with Vitest and Playwright

### Code Quality
- **Biome** for linting and formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks** for automated quality checks
- **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline
- **Bundle analysis** and performance monitoring

## Architecture Principles

### Feature-Based Organization
Each feature is self-contained with its own components, stores, routes, and types. This promotes code isolation and makes the codebase easier to maintain and test.

### Component Composition
UI is built through composition of small, reusable components. Complex interfaces are assembled from simple, focused components.

### Type-Driven Development
Comprehensive TypeScript usage ensures code reliability and provides excellent developer experience with IntelliSense and compile-time error detection.

### Performance First
Built-in performance monitoring, bundle analysis, and optimization techniques ensure fast loading times and smooth user experience.

## Demo Features

This starter includes working examples to demonstrate patterns and practices:

- **Todo Application**: Complete CRUD operations with MobX state management
- **API Integration**: HTTP client setup with error handling
- **Form Handling**: Dynamic forms with validation and field arrays
- **Layout System**: Multiple layout patterns (sidebar, fullscreen)
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery

## Target Use Cases

This starter kit is ideal for:

- **New React projects** requiring modern tooling and patterns
- **Team onboarding** to demonstrate best practices
- **Prototyping** with pre-configured components and tools
- **Learning** modern React development techniques
- **Reference implementation** for architecture decisions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. Explore the features and adapt to your needs

The codebase is designed to be understandable, well-documented, and easy to modify for your specific requirements.
