# Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architectural decisions and patterns used in the React Starter Kit.

## Design Principles

### 1. Feature-Based Organization
The codebase is organized around business features rather than technical layers. Each feature contains all related code: components, stores, routes, types, and translations.

```
features/
└── todo/
    ├── TodoStore.ts      # State management
    ├── TodoItem.tsx      # Components
    ├── routes.ts         # Route configuration
    ├── types.ts          # TypeScript types
    └── i18n/            # Translations
        └── en.ts
```

### 2. Separation of Concerns
Clear boundaries between different responsibilities:
- **Components**: UI logic and presentation
- **Stores**: Business logic and state management
- **Services**: External API communication
- **Utilities**: Pure functions and helpers

### 3. Dependency Inversion
Higher-level modules don't depend on lower-level modules. Both depend on abstractions:
- Services use interfaces for external dependencies
- Components receive data through props and hooks
- Stores are injected through providers

### 4. Single Responsibility
Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- Components handle UI rendering and user interaction
- Stores manage application state and business rules
- Services handle external communication
- Hooks encapsulate reusable logic

## Architecture Layers

### Presentation Layer
- **React Components**: UI rendering and user interaction
- **Custom Hooks**: Component logic extraction and reuse
- **Layout Components**: Page structure and navigation

### Business Logic Layer
- **MobX Stores**: State management and business rules
- **Domain Types**: Business object definitions
- **Validation Schemas**: Data validation with Zod

### Data Access Layer
- **API Services**: HTTP communication with external services
- **Storage Utilities**: Local storage and persistence
- **Mock Services**: Development and testing data

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Routing System**: Navigation and page management
- **Provider Composition**: Application setup and configuration
- **Build Configuration**: Development and production tooling

## Key Patterns

### Provider Pattern
All application providers are composed in a single location for cleaner setup and easier testing:

```typescript
<ErrorBoundary>
  <StoreProvider>
    <Router>
      {children}
    </Router>
  </StoreProvider>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### Observer Pattern
MobX provides reactive state management through the observer pattern. Components automatically re-render when observed data changes.

### Composition over Inheritance
Complex components are built by composing simpler components rather than using inheritance hierarchies.

### Dependency Injection
Stores and services are injected through React context, making testing easier and reducing coupling.

## Data Flow

```
User Interaction
     ↓
  Component
     ↓
    Hook
     ↓
   Store
     ↓
  Service
     ↓
External API
```

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with UI components
2. **Component**: Handles event and calls appropriate hook or store method
3. **Hook**: Encapsulates logic and calls store methods if needed
4. **Store**: Updates state and may call services for data
5. **Service**: Communicates with external APIs
6. **State Update**: MobX notifies observers of state changes
7. **Re-render**: Components automatically update

## Error Handling

### Error Boundaries
React Error Boundaries catch JavaScript errors in component trees and display fallback UI.

### Service Layer Errors
API errors are handled at the service layer and transformed into application-specific error objects.

### Form Validation
Client-side validation using Zod schemas with server-side validation as backup.

### Global Error Handling
Unhandled errors are captured and logged for debugging and monitoring.

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
Features are lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle size.

### Component Memoization
Expensive components are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Bundle Optimization
Vite's tree-shaking and code-splitting optimize the final bundle.

### State Management
MobX's fine-grained reactivity ensures only necessary components re-render.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Individual components and utilities are tested in isolation.

### Integration Testing
Feature modules are tested as complete units.

### End-to-End Testing
User workflows are tested through the complete application stack.

### Visual Testing
Component appearance is verified through visual regression testing.
